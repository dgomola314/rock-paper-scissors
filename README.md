This is the first project I did from The Odin Project curriculum which incorporates all three major languages on the web (HTML, CSS and JavaScript). JavaScript part was particularly challenging because it was necessary to apply in practice a lot of new things I learned in the previous lessons on JavaScript Basics. The most important thing is that I did this project the way I envisioned it and I'm very proud of it.
